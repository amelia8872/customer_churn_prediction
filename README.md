# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning


Customer Churn Prediction is a complete machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn for a real-world banking dataset, with the objective of identifying customers likely to leave the bank and providing actionable retention insights. To achieve this, I developed and trained various models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Voting Classifiers, and rigorously evaluated their performance. Additionally, the models were improved through techniques like Feature Engineering, SMOTE to handle class imbalance, and ensemble methods to enhance prediction robustness. The best-performing models were deployed into a Streamlit web application that generates churn predictions, explains the factors influencing the predictions, and provides personalized retention strategies, helping the bank proactively retain at-risk customers.
